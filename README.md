# Task1 - Data Cleaning

## What I Did
- Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure  
- Removed duplicate rows  
- Handled missing values (dropping or imputing where appropriate)  
- Fixed data types (e.g. numeric vs categorical)  
- Cleaned up inconsistent entries / formatting  

## Why
To make the data reliable for further analysis / modelling by ensuring no duplicate or invalid entries, properly typed columns, and minimal missing data.

## How to Use
1. Install required libraries (e.g. pandas, numpy).  
2. Place the raw data in `data/` folder (or update the path).
